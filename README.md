Getting GLPI up and running on your system is a breeze now


## Get started

Note that we focus on GLPI 9.5.5 and its compatible plugins

1. Datainjection 2.9.0
2. Mreporting 1.7.3
3. Addressing 2.9.0
4. Fusioninventory 3.0
5. Ocsinventoryng 1.7.3
6. Print pdf 2.0.0
7. Shellcommands 3.0.0

### Requirements

Must have docker & docker-compose on your system!

Download the latest release from this repo.

### Default installation

Launch the stack (Assuming that `docker-compose.yml` is within the directory `glpi`)

```shell
git clone https://github.com/medilies/glpi-docker
```

```shell
cd glpi-docker
```

```shell
docker-compose up
```

Install GLPI and our selected plugins
```shell
docker container exec -it glpi-docker_web_1 chmod -R +x /scripts/
```
```shell
docker container exec -it glpi-docker_web_1 /scripts/full_setup.sh
```
```shell
docker container exec -it glpi-docker_db_1 chmod -R +x /scripts/
```

```shell
docker container exec -it glpi-docker_db_1 /scripts/setup.sh
```

The previous commands mainly install GLPI with its plugins and Set crontabs to backup DB & web files daily.

## Backup & Restoring

### Manual Backups

-   DB backup

    ```shell
    docker container exec -it glpi-docker_db_1 /scripts/db_backup.sh
    ```

-   Web files backup

    ```shell
    docker container exec -it glpi-docker_web_1 /scripts/web_files_backup.sh
    ```
#### Where to find the dumped backups
Backups are dumped into their respective containers `/backups` folder.

**NOTE:** backup folders are mapped to the host system:

-   DB: `glpi-docker/stack_dumps/db_backups:/backups`
-   WEB: `glpi-docker/stack_dumps/web_files_backups:/backups`

### Manual backups restorations

-   DB restoration

    ```shell
    docker container exec -it glpi-docker_db_1 /scripts/db_restore.sh
    ```

-   Web files restoration

    ```shell
    docker container exec -it glpi-docker_web_1 /scripts/web_files_restore.sh
    ```

Both commands will ask you for the backup absolute path in the container (`/backups/<timestamp>_glpi_db_backup.sql`,
`/backups/<timestamp>_glpi_web_backup.tar.gz`).

### Crontab backups

If you have followed the default installation, backup scripts are set to run every 8 hours (`0 */8 * * *`). That is set within `DB:/scripts/cron_db_backup.sh` `WEB:/scripts/cron_web_files_backer.sh`

## Stack customization

(If you are familiare with Docker)

Before starting the containers :

-   It is vital for the security of your deployment to edit the sercrets values within `./secrets`
-   Open `./docker-compose.yml` and edit the the lines where you see the comment `# CHANGE` to suit your environment

## TODO

-   Add interactivity to the shell scripts to select plugins to install and which versions
-   Integrate OCS
